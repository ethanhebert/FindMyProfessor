DESCRIPTION
This is a web app which allows a user to find Louisiana Tech
professors' offices as well as other information such as department
and email. The user can search a professor's name in the search bar
and that professor's office will be pinned on the Google Map in the window.

CREATION
The web app was constructed using an HTML/CSS/JS framework. Within the HTML
file is connection to the Google Maps API, and the API is utilized within
the JS file. This is where the actual data parsing and placement of office
markers occurs. On the Google Cloud Console, I used the Google Maps Styles
feature to create a custom map style that only shows essential labels
to the app with a custom LATech color scheme consistent with the webpage.
The app is hosted on an nginx server. Within the nginx server
is a configuration file which enables the proper port settings to run on 
Google Cloud. I then created a Dockerfile to containerize the app and
include directions to install the nginx server on wherever the app is
hosted. I then uploaded this container to Google Cloud Run which handles
serving the app on the web. A URL was produced by Cloud Run, and my app
was live!
